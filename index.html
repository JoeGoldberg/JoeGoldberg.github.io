		<li>Determines the flow by defining how one component or executable relates to others via predecessor/successor relationships</li> 
		<li>Checks suuccess or failure to determine if the next steps should be performed or not</li>
		<li>Automatically captures output and makes it available for human vonsumption such as problem determination</>
	</ul>
